# myEyes - Colette Speer

This is the repository for my final project at DevBootcamp. This README will document my progess and the development of the app. Here is the pitch for the app:

> Imagine you’re visiting a new city. How do you decide what you are going to do, what sites you are going to see? Or, how about, you’re visiting a college. What about the school is going to make you want to go there?

> Meet myEyes, an app that is a platform for people to publish tours. These could be college tours, gastronomy tours, or tours fo farmers markets with charcuterie and fine cheese.

> The app is geolocation sensitive so as you move about within the space the tour changes so you can follow along step-by-step or you can take your own route and the information will be available for you as you move about. It can be done in a confined space like a museum or school, or it can be done on a larger scope like a whole city.

> It could also be used for coordinating events like a scavenger hunt or road rally. The content of the app would be dynamically driven where users and publishers can vote on different tours. The tours will be written by community members. This app is a way for you to see the world through myEyes.

## Goals
I am going to use this project to grow in multiple ways. I am going to grow as a developer, as a student, and as a self driven person. I am going to practice my time management and self discipline. I am going to learn how to get the most out of resources available.


## User stories
* As a user I want to be able to signup/signin/signout
* As a user I want to be able use a tour
* As a user I want to be able to create a tour
* As a user I want to browse tours by location
* As a user I want to browse tours by interest
* As a user I want to be able to see all tours
* As a user I want to be able to save tours I like "favorite"
* As a user I want to be able to see tours by me
* As a user I want to see all of the tours written by another user
* As a user I want to be able to interact with other users
* As a user I want to be able to see how many times a tour has been favorited
* As a user I want to be able to "Save for Later"
* As a user I want to be able to organize tours into trips (plan)

## Game Plan
I am going to start by mapping out how I want to write this app. What models/migrations am I going to need? How is my data going to relate to each other? What is my schema? How is my app going to be presented? What are the wireframes? I am going to figure this all out by the end of the day today (6/25) and then use trello to create a kanban board to keep myself on track with hard deadlines.
